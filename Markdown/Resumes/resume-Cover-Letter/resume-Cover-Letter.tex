\opening{Dear Recruiting Team,} 
With this letter I hereby wish to apply for the \textbf{Senior Data
Scientist} position at Employer Name in Capitalized Title.

I do believe that combination of three things: my long-term experience
as a Data Scientist, extensive knowledge of Machine Learning algorithms
and tooling as well as talent for gaining new domain knowledge very fast
makes me the right candidate for this position. As you may note in my
CV, I coordinated multiple international teams and produced high quality
localized websites. For several years I was taking care of the customer
needs by providing and delivering professional, helpful, high quality
service and assistance before, during, and after the customer's
requirements are met. My various roles within Internet related companies
were all focused on customer satisfaction. I have always been trying to
understand consumer's needs in order to provide the best service. French
native who lived and worked in many different places, I am an
open-minded person, able to think out of the box and with a good sense
of humor. I can communicate effectively and efficiently at all levels of
hierarchy and I know how to recruit, coach and motivate teams.


Please find out more on my qualifications by reading enclosed Résumé. Thank you very much in advance for your consideration. If you have any further questions regarding my candidature, please contact me via telephone or e-mail.
